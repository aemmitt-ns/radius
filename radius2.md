`radius2` is a command line utility that can be installed with `cargo install radius2`. It allows users to solve reversing problems quickly using symbolic execution and aims to be both user friendly and flexible enough to do nearly any task straight from the terminal. Running `radius2 -h` outputs the usage information

```

The only required argument is `--path` and the default behaviour of `radius2` is simply to begin execution from an `entry_state`, a state at the entrypoint of the program and run until the program exits, so `radius2 -p /bin/ls` will run, print nothing, and finish. To see what is "going on" the `-v` option can be used to view the instructions as they execute (`-C` will output with color)

```
$ radius2 -p /bin/ls -v
0000000100003f00:  pacibsp                                  |  
0000000100003f04:  stp x28, x27, [sp,  -0x60]!              |  96,sp,-=,x28,sp,=[8],x27,sp,8,+,=[8]
...
0000000100007154:  mov w0,  0x1                             |  0x1,w0,=
0000000100007158:  bl sym.imp.exit                          |  pc,lr,=,4294997208,pc,=
00000001000074d8:  adrp x17, 0x100008000                    |  4295000064,x17,=

```

The string on the right is ESIL, the intermediate language that is actually being executed by radius. It will be explained more below. By default no libraries are loaded and standard c functions are emulated (see the contents of radius/sims/libc.rs). Shared libraries can be loaded by using the `-L` argument to specify directories to load from. 

Symbolic values can be defined with `-s <name> <bits> <type>` where type can either be `num` or `str` to determine how the symbol is printed after evaluation. `stdin` is a special name that is automatically treated as the content of stdin, equivalent to `-s stdin 32 -f 0 stdin` (numeric file names are treated as file descriptors). A simple crackme can be solved as easily as 

```
$ radius2 -p r100 -s stdin 96 -X Incorrect
  stdin : "Code_Talkers"
```

The `-X` option tells radius2 to avoid any addresses that contain XREFs to a string containing the argument. States that reach avoided address are discarded and the first state to finish execution without being discarded is used to evaluate the symbolic values. Addresses to avoid can be manually set like `-x 0x400855`, the addresses can be in decimal or hex (or octal or binary if you wanna get real nuts), can include symbols and even be offsets from symbols like 

```
$ radius2 -p r100 -s stdin 96 -x main+109
  stdin : "Code_Talkers"
```

Conversely breakpoints, target addresses where execution should stop and evaluate, can be set with `-b` and string xref breakpoints with `-B` so `radius2 -p r100 -s stdin 96 -B Nice` also works.  

More complicated code may require state merging to finish in a reasonable time like in this example where `0x00400811` is designated as a merge point

```
$ radius2 -p r200 -s stdin 48 -X Incorrect -m 0x00400811
  stdin : "rotors"
```

`radius2` can also set symbolic file contents using `-s sym 4096 -f /path/to/file sym` and symbolic argv values with `-A ls @-l sym`  (the @ is necessary to stop it from being taken as an option to `radius2` itself). For both `-f` and `-A` any string which has not been defined as a symbol name will simply be that string. Files that are not supplied will be read from the real filesystem, but will never be written to. An example of these and other features is the solution to `unbreakable`

```
$ radius2 -p unbreakable -s flag 408 -c flag 'CTF{' -B 'Thank you' -z -A . flag
  flag : "CTF{0The1Quick2Brown3Fox4Jumped5Over6The7Lazy8Fox9}"
```

This example also constrains the first four bytes of `flag` to be "CTF{" with `-c` and passes `-z` to enable lazy solving, which will significantly speed up runtime (from 1 second down to 0.4 or so). In some cases string XREFs may not be found, in this case try passing `-r aae` which will tell r2 to emulate the program to find additional references. 

`radius2` also has a basic testcase generation option, `-F <dir>` which will generate files containing values of the defined symbols for each different execution path. 

```
$ radius2 -p ais3 -s flag 256 -A . flag -F testcases -P
init time:      74039
run time:       194957
instructions:   2226
instr/usec:     0.011418
generated:      5
total time:     269024
$ ls testcases 
flag0000 flag0001 flag0002 flag0003 flag0004 flag0005
$ cat testcases/flag0005
ais3{I_tak3_g00d_n0t3s}
```

Here the `-P` option causes `radius2` to print out some profiling information. Times are measured in microseconds so it took 0.27 seconds to explore every path of the program and generate the 5 unique testcases that traverse each one. The flag value is contained in the last one (it usually is). 

However the most powerful feature of `radius2` is the ability to write arbitrary hooks with ESIL. The previous example could also be solved using 

```
$ radius2 -p r200 -s stdin 48 -m 0x4007ba -H 0x400849 'eax,!,?{,stdin,.,}'
000000000040084a: #x000073726f746f72 "rotors\u{0}\u{0}"
```

Instead of placing breakpoints or avoidpoints, this example hooks the address `0x400849` so that when reached by a state the expression `eax,!,?{,stdin,.,}` will be executed. This address is at the end of the validation function which is 0 when the input is correct. ESIL is a simple stack based VM that pushes values to a stack and has operators that pop them off and push the results. Here `eax` is pushed to the stack, then `!` pops it off and pushes its boolean negation (so pushing 1 if `eax` is 0, 0 otherwise). Next `?{` is a conditional that executes the expression between the brackets if the popped value is nonzero, and `stdin,.` simply evaluates and prints `stdin`. A table of ESIL operators can be viewed by running `ae??` in r2 and is reproduced below 


```

```

In addition to these operators `radius2` adds a few special ones, namely `.`, `_`, and `!!`. `.` we have already seen. The operator `_` constrains the popped argument to be not equal to 0 and `!!` sets the state to break, as if it hit a breakpoint. 

As noted above ESIL is also what all instructions are lifted into so it can be instructive to read the expressions in the verbose output. Since ESIL can define any instruction it is essentially possible to do nearly anything with an ESIL hook. 

Uhhhhhhh what else? `radius2` can initialize states from a process running in a local or remote debugger so `radius2 -p dbg://192.168.1.123:5555 -a addr -s sym 64 num -S x0 sym 64` will place a breakpoint and once hit will initiallize the state with the current context of the debuggee, set the register `x0` to a symbolic value, and then start symbolic execution. This can also be done with frida so `radius2 -p frida://usb/attach//wpa_supplicant -a free ...` will set a hook on `free` and when the hook is hit will initialize an exact state of the current process. You can even use `radius2` on a process running in `qemu` or attached via JTAG with `gdb://`.

In a blog post Trail of Bits described its symbolic execution tool `manticore` with the expression "there's more than one way to skin a cat" and called `manticore` a "cat skinning machine". As `radius2` is orders of magnitude faster, works on more architectures and file formats, and is even more flexible than `manticore`, `radius2` should be thought of as a Cat-Skinning Optimus Prime.
